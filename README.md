# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This is a Prework Study guide for boot camp students to refer to while going over the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, and helps you choose which topic to study first if the DevTools are opened.

This will be a useful resource to refer to for some foundational web development information.
